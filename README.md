# Inktober 2022

The [Inktober](https://inktober.com) challenge consists in drawing something related to the daily theme.

Since I can't draw but still wanted to work on my creativity, I decided to do not drawings but webpages
inspired by some of the video games I love.

You can see the result [here](https://ahzelesteak.github.io/inktober2022/), enjoy !
